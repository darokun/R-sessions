## Hey there!

I hope you're not TOO overwhelmed from the first week of studies!

I know some of you might want to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) in your own computers. 
You can install R in any computer, for free, and with any common Operative System (e.g., Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

Everything is clear on this week's R-course lecture slides, but if you still haven't got the slides, or you need an extra kick, you may want to take a look at these youtube videos:

* [Install R on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G09dfkFAsj4)
* [Install R on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJxVRgiX-ik)

* [Install RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MJT9Ofb7Z8)

As usual, you're free to write me an email if you need help, assistance, or want to discuss nerdy stuff about R programming, statistics or epidemiology in general (:
