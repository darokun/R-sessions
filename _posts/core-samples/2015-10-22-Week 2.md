## Introduction

Hey everybody!

Congratulations on going through our second week of the R-course!

Learning R is hard at first, and I know some of you might still be struggling with it, but I can see your commitment and perseverance, and I assure that you're all getting closer and closer to master it!

In this email, I would like to address and strengthen 3 main topics:
1. Downloading the datasets (and importing into R)
2. Plotting in R
3. Optional resources to learn and practice R on your own


### 1. Downloading the datasets:
Some of you may be interested in downloading the datasets to your own computer, and further importing them into R. 
Follow these instructions in order to do so: 
![Downloading Datasets](https://40.media.tumblr.com/329ee1305f3bfb60abccc1d8af483fef/tumblr_nx1k08emo31qahqiuo1_540.png)
The link you need to go to is [here](http://www.en.msc-epidemiologie.med.uni-muenchen.de/msc/teaching/winterterm15_16/quantitative_methodes/index.html)

### 2. Plotting in R:
Plotting in R is super fun! You may have notice that you're in control of almost anything that you want to add to -or remove from- your plots! Here are some useful resources about it:

* [A short (~5 mins.) video review of how to plot in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjcUlHh3UJg)

* [A collection of color codes and names](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf)

### 3. Optional resources to learn and practice R on your own:
There are a lot of resources out there on the web to learn and practice R on your own. I have used some of these in the past while I was learning R, and they really helped a lot! Just click on the links to access them:

* [R Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf): a collection of the most commonly used functions in R, all in four sheets of paper!
* [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/): Very nice interactive and pirate-themed webpage to learn R.
* [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): Nice (and free!) courses on R, Programming and Data Science.
* [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/): We're using this package during the R-sessions in order to interactively learn R, from within R. To install swirl, you only need to type these three lines in R, and then follow the instructions:

`install.packages("swirl")`    
`library(swirl)`    
`swirl()`

### Finally,
I invite you all once again to the **R-sessions** (optional).

**What**: R-sessions.    
**When**: Saturdays, 11am-2pm.    
**Where**: KR5 (The computer lab at Klinikum Gro√ühadern).    

Last week we used swirl together, but this week we'll do more independent work. You're free to do this week's exercises, work on swirl or any of the other resources, or just explore R on your own. I'll be there to assist you all and clear up any questions you may have. Bring your own laptops if you want!

And as usual, you may write me back if you have any questions, help with the code, suggestions, or anything (:
